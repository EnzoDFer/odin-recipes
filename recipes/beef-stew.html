        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a great recipe to try your hand at a simple beef stew for those cold and wintery days.  Like all stews, these can be easily modified and tailored to anyone's preference! Feel free to substitute seasonings to match the flavors you are going for.</p>
        <p>Personally, I think the lentils are the star of the stew!  They help to bring all the other flavors together and provide the base for every bite.</p>
